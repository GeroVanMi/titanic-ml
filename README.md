# Kaggle Titanic ML Introduction

This repository contains the code needed to make a prediction for the [Kaggle
Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

Setup 
-

In order to be able to run `main.py` you first need to download the [test.csv 
and train.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and store 
them in a new folder: `/assets/data`.

Your structure should look like this:  
```
- assets  
  - data  
    - test.csv
    - train.csv
```
